Week 2 106CR Report

As the game concept was a bargain hunt, the first thing that came to mind in the principles of this game was to make sure the user is searching for something they need. As a group we knew that this game has to be engaging and attractive for the users, and to ensure that the game would be human-centred so that we could focus on the humans as well as the technology for the design. Furthermore, we have to make sure that anyone can use the bargain hunt game so that they won’t need a particular set of skills to play the game. Efficiency of the bargain hunt game is key so that the user will not have to encounter any problems which also links with satisfaction. This is because if the program is efficient with no problems encountered, the user should then be satisfied if they have then been able to find what they have been looking for. Another key aim is the utility of the game, due to the fact that the user should be able to get what they are looking for when using the program. Through the first tutorial, many examples were shown to give us an idea on what concepts to consider. Different principles were considered before we made the decision that the principles for our group were that it should be easy to use, using the criteria that we are going to create this should do just that giving the user many options to find the right car for them using many options to give the user a variety of different cars. Also the user will be able to know the location of the car the user is looking for which will help as they can then see how car it is from them. The idea that we chose was a car database, trying to find the cheapest car or specific cars that most suited the users’ wants. On the design concept, we all agreed on having an image of the UK showing garages across the country. Each of these had a selection of cars and on the side of the map would be a search where you could search for specific cars. For example, you could choose whether you’re looking for a car with 3 doors or 5 doors and a specific colour or brand. Basically, it would be like an Auto Trader with the way it searches for cars, but the difference is that the bargain hunt is going to show a picture of the UK, showing the garages and so when the search is done, the garages that fits the criteria of the car searched will be shown.
